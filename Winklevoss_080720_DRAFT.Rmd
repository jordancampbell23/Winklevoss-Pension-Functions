## Chapter 1: Pension Plan Benefits

### **I. Retirement Benefit**

* Eligibility
     + Normal Retirement: Age 65
     + Early Retirement: Age 55 and 10 years of service

* Benefit
    + 1.5 percent of 5-year average salary per year of service, payable 
    for life, actuarially reduced for early retirement
          

### **II. Vested Benefit**

* Eligibility
    + Full vesting after 5 years of service  
         
* Benefit
    + Accrued benefit (based on the retirement benefit formula applied to
    final average salary and service at termination), payable at age 65 for life  
         

### **III. Disability Benefit**

* Eligibility
    + Age 40 and 10 years of service  
          
* Benefit
    + Accrued unreduced benefit, payable immediately for life

### **IV. Death Benefit**

* Eligibility
    + 5 years of service  
          
* Benefit
    + 50 percent of accrued benefit, payable for life of surviving spouse, commencing
           when employee would have been eligible for early retirement  
           
### **V. Employee Contributions**

* No vesting/formula

<br>

Benefit formula = multiplier * years of service * final average salary<br>

Multiplier = 2%<br>

Years of Service = (60 - 30) = 30<br>

Final Average Salary (5 years of your highest salary): 80k<br>

Annual Benefit = 2% * 30 * $80,000<br>

Annual Benefit = 48,000<br>

What if you have a COLA?

## Chapter 2: Actuarial Assumptions

### **Decrement Assumptions**

* Decrement Asssumptions:
     + Active members: death, termination, disability, and retirement.
     
     + Non-active members: death only
     
     + Single-decrement environment: probability of decrement (q) = rate of decrement (q')
     
     + Multiple-decrement environment: q (probability) < q' (rate)
     
          + 2 decrement environment: $$\mathbf{q^{(1)} = q'^{(1)} [1 - \frac{1}{2} q'^{(2)}]}$$
          
``` {r, eval = T}

double_decrement <- function(qr_1, qr_2) {
  
  qr_1 * (1 - (1/2) * qr_2)
  
}


```


          
  + 3 decrement environment: $$\mathbf{q^{(1)} = q'^{(1)} [1 - \frac{1}{2} (q'^{(2)} +      q'^{(3)}) + \frac{1}{3}q'^{(2)} q'^{(3)}]}$$
          
          
``` {r, eval = T}

three_decrement <- function(qr_1, qr_2, qr_3) {
  
  qr_1 * (1 - ((1/2) * (qr_2 + qr_3)) + ((1/3) * (qr_2 * qr_3)))
  
}


```
          
          

* Mortality Decrement:
  + Probability of a life age *x* living *n* years:
     
     $$\mathbf{P_{x \to n} = \prod_{t = 0}^{n-1} (1 - q'^{(m)}_{x + t}) = \prod_{t = 0}^{n-1} (p'^{(m)}_{x + t})}$$
     
  + Note that *p* and *q* are complementary probabilties of each other

### Composite Survival Function:

$${p_{x}^{(T)} = (1 - q'^{(m)}_x) (1 - q'^{(t)}_x) (1 - q'^{(d)}_x) (1 - q'^{(r)}_x)}$$


* Probability of surviving in active service for n years: $$\mathbf{p^{(T)}_{n \to x} = \prod_{t = 0}^{n-1} p_{x + t}^{(T)} }$$


### Total Number of Employees Leaving Active Service During the Year:
* *l* is the notation for the survivors at age x 

$$\ d_x^{(T)} =  l_x^{(T)} q_x^{(T)}$$

### Age Functions (reference in downstream equations/functions)

## DISCOUNT FACTOR FUNCTIONS

## Discount factor from x to r

get_vrx <- function(ea, retire, i) {
  age_information(ea, retire)
  vrx <- c(1 / ((1 + i) ^ (rx)))
  return(vrx)
}

## Discount factor from x to r & r to 100

  # generating discount vector for entry age to maximum age of the model(100)
  
  vxr <-

  return(vxr)
  
}


```



### Salary Function:

$$\ S_x = \sum_{t = y}^{x - 1} s_t$$

***Actual Salary***
``` {r}
# ea <<- i_ea ... entry age of members, multiple entry ages are not introduced yet
# retire <<- retire ... retirement age
# a_sgr = past salary growth rate
# yos_xy <<- seq(ea:retire) - 1  # years of service vector

  age_information(ea,retire)
  
  # actual salary at age x
  
  return(c((1 + a_sgr) ^ yos_xy))
}

```

***Expected Salary***
``` {r}
get_exp_sal <- function(ea,retire,sgr) {
  age_information(ea,retire)
  # expected salary at age x
  return(c((1 + sgr) ^ yos_xy))
}

```

***Accumulated Salary***
```{r}

############## Accumlated Salary ############
get_acc_sal <- function(ea,retire,a_sgr) {
  act_sal <- get_act_sal(ea,retire,a_sgr)
  #acculumated salary at age x
  return(c(cumsum(act_sal)))
}
```

***Expected Salary at Retirement***
```{r}
############## Expected Salary at retirement ############
get_exp_sal_r <- function(ea,retire,a_sgr,sgr) {
  act_sal <- get_act_sal(ea,retire,a_sgr)
  exp_sal_r <- act_sal * ((1 + sgr) ^ rx) # expected salary at age r in year x
  return(exp_sal_r)
}

```

***Salary for Constant Inflation Rate for Different Entry Ages***
```{r}
##############  Salary for constant inflation rate for different entry ages ############
get_sal_vector_ea <- function(ea,retire,sal,inflation,sgr){
  return((((1 + (inflation / 100)) ^ yos_xy)/(1 + ((sgr) / 100)) ^ yos_xy)*sal)
}
```

***Entry Salary from Current Salary for Constant Inflation Rate***
``` {r}
############## Entry salary from current Salary for constant inflation rate ############
get_sal_ca_ea<- function(ea,ca,retire,sal,inflation,sgr){
  return(((1 + ((sgr) / 100)) ^ yos_xy[length(age)-(retire-ca)])/((1 + (inflation / 100)) ^ yos_xy[length(age)-(retire-ca)])*sal)
}

```



### Salary at age *x*:
* $s_y$ = entry-age dollar salary
* $(SS_x)$ = merit salary scale at age x
* *I* = rate of inflation
* *P* = rate of productivity reflected in the salary increases.

$$s_x = s_y \frac{(SS_x)}{(SS_y)} [(1 + I ) (1 + P)]^{(x - y)}$$ 






### Benefit Function
* Final average salary function:
+ $B_r$ =  the projected retirement benefit, assuming retirement occurs at the beginning of age
+ $r$ = age at retirement
+ $n$ = number of years over which the participant's salary prior to retirement is averaged
+ $(r - y)$ = years of service
+ $k$ = multiplier

$$B_r = k (r - y) \frac{1}{n} \sum_{t = r - n}^{r - 1} s_t$$
or more simply

$$B_r = k (r - y) \frac{1}{n} (S_r - S_{r - n})$$

### Annuity Function:

* **Straight Life Annuity:**

$$\ddot{a}_{x} = \sum_{t = 0}^{\infty} p_{t \to x}^{(m)} v^{t}$$

```{r, eval = F}

get_ar <- function(ea,retire,i,cola,mort) {
  
  # sum of product of discount factor after retirement, probablity 
  #of survival after 65, cola and years of service after retirement 
  
  ar <-
    sum(get_vxr(ea, retire, i)
        [(length(get_vrx(ea, retire, i))):length(get_vxr(ea, retire, i))] * 
          
          c(get_rpmx(ea, retire, mort)[length(get_rpmx(ea, retire, mort))], 
            na.omit(get_xpmr(ea, retire, mort))) *
          
          ((1 + cola) ^ yos_r_max_mort))
  
  return(ar)
  
}
```



* **Period Certain Life Annuity:**

$$\ddot{a}_{\overline{{x:n}\lnot}} = [{\sum_{t = 0}^{n - 1} v^{t}}] {\space} + {\space} p_{n \to x}^{(m)} {\space} {\space} v^{n} {\space} \dddot{a}_{x + n}$$

```{r}
get_am <- function(ea, retire, i, amortization) {
  
  vxr <- get_vxr(ea, retire, i)
  
  # sum of discount factor from entry age to entry age + amortization period
  
  am <- sum(vxr[1:(amortization - 1)])
  
  return(am)
  
}

```



* **Temporary Annuity**

* Normal Version:

$$\ddot{a}_{\overline{x:n\lnot}} = \sum_{t = 0}^{n - 1} p_{t \to x}^{(T)} v^{t}$$
     
  + Salary-Based Version:
  
$$\ddot{a}_{\overline{x:n\lnot}} = {\sum_{t = 0}^{n - 1}{\frac{s_t}{s_x}}} p_{t - x \to x}^{(T)} v^{t - x}$$

One purpose of the temporary annuity is to calculate the actuarial present value of future salary


Normal cost Rate = (PV of Future Benefits) / (PV of Future Salaries)

## Chapter 4: Pension Plan Population Theory

### Basic Concepts

* **Active employees** make up the primary group within the plan’s membership, and the following discussion focuses on them.

* **Retired employees** represent another subpopulation, and for present purposes, this group is assumed to consist only of members who retired directly form the service of the employer.

* **Vested terminated** employees make up a third group, which can be further divided into those in the benefit deferral period and those receiving benefits.

* **Disabled employees** make up the fourth sub-population for plans providing disability benefits, and beneficiaries.

* **Surviving spouses** make up a fifth sub-population.



### Stationary Population
A population is considered to be stationary when its size and age distribution remain constant year after year. 


### Mature Population
If the increments to the population (newly hired employees) increase at a constant rate, the population will attain a constant percentage age and service distribution in precisely the same length of time as required for a population to become stationary. 


### Undermature Population
A population is considered undermature if its age and service distribution has a larger portion of younger, short-service employees than that of a mature population that faces the same decremental factors, is of the same size, and experiences the same entry age distribution.


### Overmature Population
An overmature population is one that has a disproportionately large number of employees at older ages and with longer periods of service than that of a mature population based on the same decrement and entry age assumptions.


### Size-Constrained Population
A size-constrained population will generally converge to its stationary counterpart created without a size constraint. The length of time required for the convergence is a function of the number of ages in the population and the rates of decrements at each of its ages. 

Naturally, the more attained ages, other things being equal, the longer it will take for the size-constrained population to come within a predetermined tolerance level of its stationary counterpart. 


### Model Plan Populaiton
When dealing with the plan as a whole, it is necessary to assume an age and service distribution of plan members, a specific salary structure of active employees, and a benefit structure of non-active plan members.

In the interest of generality, numerous plan populations, in varying states of maturity, are assumed for the numerical illustrations.

The experience of a single plan population is simulated over a period of 50 years. In order to simulate the various maturity statuses, the initial plan population is undermature and is then forced through a mature state to an overmature status. This is accomplished by first having the size of the population increase at a decreasing rate and eventually decrease at an increasing rate. 


### Chen & Matkin R Functions

**Generate Population**
```{r}
generate_pop <- function(ea, retire, pop_type, pop_size, median) {
  
  # calling age information to get age bounds for population
  age_information(ea, retire)
  
  # generating empty vector of size of age range
  pop1<-numeric(retire - ea + 1)
  
  # Conditional statements to generate population based on user 
  # input for population 
  if (pop_type == 'Customize curve')
    pop1 <-round(rtnorm(pop_size, median, 15, left = ea-1, right = retire + 1))
  
  if (pop_type == 'Over mature')
    pop1 <- round(rtnorm(pop_size, retire, 15, left = ea-1, right = retire + 1))
  
  if (pop_type == 'Under mature')
    pop1 <- round(rtnorm(pop_size, ea, 15, left = ea-1, right = retire + 1))
  
  if (pop_type == 'Uniform'){
    repcount <- round(pop_size/(retire-ea))
    for(i in ea:retire)
      pop1<-c(pop1,rep(i,repcount))
    pop1<-pop1[pop1!=0]
  }
  
  # truncating population exceeding the age range
  pop1<-pop1[pop1!=ea-1]
  pop1<-pop1[pop1!=retire+1]
  
  # return population vector to server.R
  return(pop1)
}
```


**Generate Retirees Population**
```{r}
population_retirees<-function(ea, retire, population){
  # Getting active population frequencies for each age group ###
  pop_freq <- table(population)
  
  # generating retiree population frequencies for each age after retirement to 
  # max_age without considering decline after max age
  pop2 <- rep(pop_freq[length(pop_freq)], max_age - retire) 
  
  # empty vector
  pop3 <- 0
  
  # age just after retirement ###
  j <- retire + 1
  
  # translating the retiree frequency to population for age distribution plot
  for(i in pop2){
    
    pop3 <-c(pop3,rep(j,i))
    
    j = j + 1
    
    if(j == max_age + 1)
      
      break;
  }
  
  # truncating any active members in the population of retirees
  pop3 <- pop3[2:length(pop3)]
  
  # return population vector to server.R
  return(pop3)
}
```


**Age Group Generate After Max Age**
```{r}
pop_after_max_age <- function(ea, retire){
  
  age_information(ea, retire)
  
  return(rep(0, max_mort_age - max_age))
}
```


**Total Population**
```{r}
get_total_pop<- function(ea, retire, pop_type, pop_size, median){
  
  active <- generate_pop(ea, retire, pop_type, pop_size, median)
  
  retirees <- population_retirees(ea, retire, active)
  
  after_max_age <- pop_after_max_age(ea, retire)
  
  return(c(table(c(active, retirees)), after_max_age))
}

```

## Chapter 5: Pension Liability Measures

### General Case

* Actuarial Accrued Liability equals the present value of benefits allocated to date.B' represents the benefits allocated under a given actuarial cost method.

$$^r(AL)_x = B'_x {\space} _{r - x}p_x^{(T)} {\space} v^{r - x} {\space} \ddot{a}_r$$

### Entry Age Actuarial Liability 

* The actuarial accrued liability equals the present value of future benefits, prorated by the salary-based temporary annuity ratio.

$$^{CP{\space}r}(AL)_x = \frac{^s \ddot{a}^{T}_{y:x - y \neg}}{^s \ddot{a}^{T}_{y:r - y \neg}}  B_r {\space} _{r - x}p_x^{(T)} {\space} v^{r - x} {\space} \ddot{a}_r$$

$$^{CP{\space}r}(AL)_x = \frac{^s \ddot{a}^{T}_{y:x - y \neg}}{^s \ddot{a}^{T}_{y:r - y \neg}} {\space} ^r(PVFB)_x$$

**Present Value of Future Benefits (from x to r)**
```{r}

get_rPVFBx <- function(ea,retire,i,a_sgr,sgr,cola,afc,bf,mort) {
  # product of discount factor to retirement age ,probablity to continue 
  # to retirement age,accumulated benefits at 65 and annuity factor for a dollar

## Chapter 6: Normal Costs

* Normal Cost is designed to amortize the PVFB over the employee's working lifetime
* PVFB = PV of future normal costs
* Actuarial Accrued Liability (AAL) = PVFB - PV of future Normal Costs
* Alternatively, AAL = accumulated value of past normal costs


* Entry age normal cost rate K:

The "cost prorate, constant percent" normal cost can be determined by equating the present value of a portion, K, of the participant's future salary tot he present value of future benefits:

$$K {\space} s_y {\space} ^s\ddot{a}^{T}_{y:r - y \lnot} = ^r(PVFB)_y$$
$$K = \frac{^r(PVFB)_y}{s_y {\space} ^s\ddot{a}^{T}_{y:r - y \lnot}}$$

Then, the normal cost at age *x* is simply this factor times attained age salary:

$$^{CP {\space} r}(NC)_x = K {\space} s_x$$

* Interesting point: there exists an infinite number of actuarial liabilities and corresponding normal costs

#### Term Cost Concept  

* If the benefit under consideration is a lump sum death benefit, the term cost is
equal to the cost of one year's term insurance in the amount of the death benefit.  


* Term cost is used in this chapter as a precursor to determining the cost of 
ancillary benefits under various cost methods.



### Vested Termination Benefits

**Term Cost**

The term cost (TC) of vested termination benefits for an employee age *x* is given
by:  

 * $g_x^{(v)}$ = grading function equal to the proportion of accrued benefit
vested at age *x*

 * $B_x$ = accrued benefit at age *x* as defined by the plan benefit formula
 
 * $q_x^{(t)}$ = probability of terminating during age *x*
 
 * $_{r-x-1}p_{x + 1}^{(m)}$ = probability of living from age *x + 1* to retirement
 
 * $v^{r -x}$ = discount factor to age x
 
 * $\ddot{a}_r$ = straight life annuity

$$^v(TC)_{x} = g_{x}^{(v)} {\space}{\space} B_x {\space}{\space} q_x^{(t)} {\space}{\space} _{r-x-1}p_{x + 1}^{(m)} {\space} {\space} v^{r - x} {\space} {\space} \ddot{a}_r$$

This formulation shows that the term cost of vesting is the expected liability
associated with the contingency that the employee may terminate vested during age
x ... *the grading function and accrued benefit function could be evaluated at age 
x + 1/2 to approximate a fractional year's credit. Similarly, the survival function
could be evaluated at this fractional age as well*.

### Disability Benefits

**Term Cost**

The term cost (TC) of disability benefits for an employee age *x* is given
by  

 * $g_x^{(v)}$ = grading function equal to the proportion of accrued benefit vested at age *x*

 * $B_x$ = accrued benefit at age *x* as defined by the plan benefit formula
 
 * $q_x^{(t)}$ = probability of disabled during age *x*
 
 * $w$ = waiting period before disability benefits commence
 
 * $_{w}^{d}p_{x + 1}^{(m)}$ = probability that a disabled life age x lives w years
 
 * $\ddot{a}^{d}_{x + w}$ = life annuity based on disabled-life mortality
 
 * $v^{w + 1}$ = discount factor to age w
 
$$^d(TC)_{x} = g_x^{(d)} {\space}{\space} B_x {\space}{\space} q_x^{(d)} {\space} {\space} _w^dp_{x + 1}^{(m)} {\space}{\space} v^{w + 1} {\space}{\space} \ddot{a}^{d}_{x + w}$$

The term cost of disability will be zero prior to the first qualification age and
will generally increase thereafter, although this need not be the case under some
benefit formulas or actuarial assumptions.


**Present Value of Future Disability Benefits**

$$^d(PVFB)_x = \sum_{k=x}^{r'-1} {\space} _{k-x}p_{x}^{(T)} {\space} v^{k-x} {\space} {\space} ^d(TC)_k$$

### Ancillary Benefits Under Actuarial Cost Methods

The total cost of both ancillary and retirement benefits under various individual
actuarial cost methods is considered in this section. The aggregate versions of
each cost method are not presented, but the principles are the same.

**Accrued Benefit Method**
The normal cost under the accrued benefit method, consistent with the underlying
theory of this method, is equal to the present value of a deferred annuity of $b_x$
(the formula benefit accrual), where the present value is based on the possibility
that the employee may either terminate vested and be entitle to a deferred vested
benefit, become disabled and receive a disability benefit, die and leave a spouse
with a benefit, or retire and recieve a retirement benefit.

The total normal cost for a participant age x can be represented by

 _{k-x}p_x^{T} v^{k-x} ({q}_k^{(t)} 
^vF_k)
